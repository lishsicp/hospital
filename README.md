The system administrator has access to a list of doctors by category (pediatrician,
traumatologist, surgeon, ...) and a list of patients. Implement the ability to sort:
1) patients:
- alphabetically;
- by date of birth;
2) doctors:
- alphabetically;
- by category;
- by number of patients.
  The administrator registers patients and doctors in the system and appoints a doctor to the
  patient.
  The doctor determines the diagnosis, makes appointments to the patient (procedures,
  medications, operations), which are recorded in the Hospital Card. The appointment can be
  made by a Nurse (procedures, medications) or a Doctor (any appointment).
  The patient can be discharged from the hospital, with a definitive diagnosis recorded.
  (Optional: implement the ability to save / export a document with information about the
  patient&#39;s discharge).
